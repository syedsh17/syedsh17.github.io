        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            I completed this project as the final programming assignment in my Object-Oriented Programming 
            course last semester, where I gained significant hands-on experience with Java and data structures. 
            The project is a Java application that implements a custom singly linked list to store and process 
            a sequence of integers read from an input file. The program dynamically builds the list, applies a 
            defined shrinking rule to modify the data, and writes the processed results to an output file. 
            Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of linked list implementation, file input 
            and output, and core object-oriented programming principles.
