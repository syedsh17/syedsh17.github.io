        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            I completed this project as part of a collaborative group assignment in my C programming 
            course in 2024, where our team earned first place in the class for the overall design 
            and implementation. I contributed to the development of a single-player Battleship game 
            written in the C programming language. The game features a 10×10 board with five ships 
            randomly placed by the system. Players fire missiles by entering a row letter and column number, 
            while the program tracks hits, misses, ship status, and total missile count. The game board 
            is updated after each move and the game concludes when all ships are sunk. The program also 
            supports saving and reloading game progress, allowing players to resume a previous session or begin a new game.
